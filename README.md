Model for predicting/screening small molecules with ability to achieve specific gene expression profile  

## TODO List
#### **Towards learning disentangled explanatory factors (2020.01-2020.02):**  
1. models: β-VAE, FactorVAE, β-TCVAE, DIP-VAE
2. metrics: BetaVAE score, FactorVAE score, Mutual Information Gap(MIG), DCI disentanglement
3. dataset: L1000 gene expression subset.
4. mian achieve: result explanation, effect of different init param.

#### **Our model**
Under discussion:  
Evaluation: test set 1) from the same distribution with training set; 2) novel cell type/small molecule;    
worth trying: Does disentanglement performance correlated with our prediction result?
