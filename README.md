# AI2GE4DD
Model for predicting/screening small molecules with ability to achieve specific gene expression profile  

### TODO List  
please feel free to add/edit
#### Towards learning disentangled explanatory factors  
Now focus on
1. models: β-VAE, FactorVAE, β-TCVAE, DIP-VAE
2. metrics: BetaVAE score, FactorVAE score, Mutual Information Gap(MIG), DCI disentanglement
3. dataset: L1000 gene expression subset.
4. mian achieve: result explanation, effect of different init param.
